          Rob Taylor started off as a gamer but has always had a passion for
          creating and building. Ever since his humble beginnings making games
          using RPG Maker VX he gained an interest in programming. This interest
          sparked Rob to pursue a Bachelors Degree in Game Development at Full
          Sail University. Thanks to his ability to pick up new skills and
          concepts quickly he make it through the accelerated program. This
          ability allowed him to learn Web Development and eventually Full-Stack
          Development to meet his professional needs.
